NodeJS_Carpool_Project
======================

This is an Future Blue Web Development team Carpool website project. We use Node.js both on the front and back end and deploy it on IBM's BlueMix.

The app.js file is the server side code and logic. Most of the html files are located in the views folder.

You will need to install node.js and express to run this server.
