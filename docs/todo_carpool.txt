WHAT NEED TO DO:

1) Log in page (Nicified).

On log in action, server sends the following information:

{
	"type":"login_info",
	"user_name":"Eric",
	"groups_managed":[1,2,3]
}

2) Landing page -> 3 actions:
	2.1) Create a group
	2.2) Look up groups
	2.3) Manage groups user already has
	

3) Create a group -> A form that sends the "create_group" message to the server. Responses are NULL or "Error". If null, prompt user "success", if error, tell the user. On ok go back to landing page.
4) Look up groups -> A table that populated by the response from the server. A click on this sends the "list_groups" request and then populates the table with the answer.
